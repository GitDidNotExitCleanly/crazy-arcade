This game is implemented based on Simple DirectMedia Layer (http://www.libsdl.org/).
All relevant dlls are included in the project.
You can find the executable file in the "Release" folder and double click to run this game.

* Sadly the explosion effect is not achieved at the moment, so that the character and the enemies still can be attacked by the bomb
* even if the animation doesn't show that.
